# largeNumbersProcessing
module for the processing of large natural numbers using linked lists. The module provides create/print/sum/diff/mult/mod/div/prime/power

## a dumb project from a dumber teacher, done in an overnight, no leak is handled, optimization is good but primeval

## next ? probalby !
- changing the module to pointers(char*) instead of linked lists (less memory usage and easier leaks to handle / it will be faster) <br>
- optimize multi [Karatsuba algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karatsuba_algorithm)
- optimize div/mod [Division_algorithms (newtons?)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Division_algorithm)
- primes [Sieve of Atkin](https://www.baeldung.com/cs/prime-number-algorithms)
- powers - simple as using a recursive approach - u can also use bit operation to make it more simple ???
